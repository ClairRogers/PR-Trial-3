                <p>Finally, you arrive. </p>
                <p>You are walking straight into the setting sun, and it’s almost blindingly bright, but this is the way the powerlines lead, and Chirek insists you keep moving until sunset. He doesn’t say it, but whispers spread through the trialcats that Chirek has started glancing over his shoulder more and more, anxiously watching the massive storm grow in the distance. It is weird that this storm has not ceased its endless rumbling since you fell back into your real world over five weeks ago.</p> 
                <p>The powerlines have been leading you up a steady slope for a while now, but the first of the group has finally started to reach the crest, stopping for some reason. When you finally reach them, your breath is taken away.</p> 
                <p>Ahead of you is the ocean. The sun is lowering into it, bright orange and yellow, sparkling off the vast expanse of sea. And between you and the sea is the ruins of an ancient human city.</p> 
                <p>The powerlines you had been following go straight into it. But there are more lines, too, coming from all different directions, all traveling into the distant city. You all stand there for a moment, marveling at the sight, before a few cats begin the descent down the slope, towards this place where you’ve been promised power.</p> 
                <p>It takes another half hour of walking to actually find yourself between buildings. As you had gotten closer, the powerlines over your head had gotten louder, pulsing faster and faster, before splitting into smaller wires and dispersing throughout the streets. You look around, follow some of the wires, looking for some sort of a secret to unlock. The sun is falling beneath the sea, and you feel like you should find something before night sets in. Chirek is leading the way, but he seems as lost as you.</p> 
                <p><b>“I thought--”</b> he starts, shaking his head. It almost seems as if he’s talking to himself. <b>“I thought there’d be...something more obvious.” </b></p>
                <p>As soon as he’s finished speaking, there is a quiet, distant rumbling noise. But not from the sky, which you’d grown used to at this point. It’s from something...below. </p>
                <p>Chirek’s eyes widen and his fur stands on end, but you can’t see why until he looks down at his paws. He’s standing on a circular metal plate, flush with the pavement. It looks like it’s quivering, and for a second Chirek looks up at you, starts to cry out-- before the hatch opens, swallows him whole, and snaps shut again. </p>
                <p>Someone darts forward to try to catch your guide, but they’re too late. It happened too fast. You make sure you aren’t also standing on one of those mysterious hatches, but the rumbling noise has stopped, and you don’t see anything else suspicious about these streets. </p>
                <p>“What are we going to do now?” someone says. </p>
                <p>“What if there’s no power here?” </p>
                <p>“Don’t be ridiculous-- what else would have taken Chirek?” </p>
                <p>“We need to find him!” </p>
                <p>The cats around you begin to bicker, and you notice right then, for some reason, that the sun has fallen, and the sky has turned from a bright orange to the soft purple of early nighttime. And then as the sun goes completely, it's as if color has been leached from the city. Lingering hues of the evening are sapped away, leaving everything bizarrely greyscale.</p>
                <p>It is when you are examining the sky that you notice… the city has come to life.</p>
                <p>You can hear noises coming from the buildings now. The soft sound of metal clanging together, of doors opening and closing, of voices floating through broken windows. It has a rhythm to it that, at first, you can’t quite pinpoint. But then you realize--it’s the same soft thrumming the powerlines had. </p>
                <p>After a few moments, the sky has gotten even a bit darker, and the city begins to light up. But not how you’d seen cities illuminated in books, but rather… with more <i>life</i>.</p>
                <p>There are suddenly odd plants snaking up the sides of the buildings that hadn’t been there moments ago, glowing soft greens and whites. Little creatures, unlike anything you’ve ever seen before, scurry out from the holes in the grounds and alleyways like rats, but they are all different, all varying in size. They are all semi-transparent, glowing different shades of pink and orange and blue and teal and just about every other color. You catch movement overhead, and see massive whale-like beasts drifting slowly between the buildings, high overhead, making soft, slow noises at one another. </p>
                <p>And then the doors of the buildings around you start to open, and the ghosts emerge. </p>
                <p>They are all sorts of different creatures, no two of them the same. Tall things with beaks that have to duck to not hit their heads in doorways. Long slithering creatures with nothing but whiskers all over their muzzles with ten legs. Two-legged insects that bounce and skit around. They all speak, all mingle like they haven’t seen each other in days. Hardly any of them pay attention to you, only the few closest glancing your direction, as if annoyed you are taking up space where they want to walk. </p>
                <p>This city is ancient, but it is anything but dead. </p>
                <p><b>”OH. MY. GOD.”</b> </p>
                <p>You turn around, and one of the ghostly creatures is staring at you all with a wide open mouth and four eyes widened in awe. It has four legs, and two arms in which it is clutching what looks to be a book of some sort to its weird, transparent chest. </p>
                <p><b>”AHHH!”</b> he squeals with absolute delight, and rushes towards you. You might have felt inclined to turn and bolt the other direction at the creepy creature, but it seems so utterly thrilled to see you there that you can’t feel threatened. <b>”You’re here! You’re finally here! Oh, just perfect, too! I was worried you wouldn’t make it in time.”</b> </p>
                <p>You have no idea what he means, but he clearly has no intention of explaining, words flying out of his odd mouth so fast you barely have time to think. <b>”You’ve already lost your guide, hm? Yes, I can see by the looks on your faces--no worries friends, for this has been prophesied since the stars first shone! You will find him again, I assure you, you will!”</b> He is almost too excited, it seems, to keep speaking for a moment. His spectacles have slipped down his nose, but he pushes them back up and composes himself.</p> 
                <p><b>"Right! So. You must already know this by now, but we believe you have come to our glorious haven to uncover the secret that lies here. As destiny has foretold! Not a single wisp here has been able to uncover it for as long as we have existed. When you uncover the secret, you shall find your friend! But hurry! You only have a few days left, after all!”</b> he chuckles to himself, as if he didn’t just say something quite ominous. </p>
                <p>You don’t have time to ask him to elaborate before he straightens up, his face alight with glee. <b>”Right, then!! Since I am the one who has found you, that makes me your new guide! I am Ludlow, and I will be reconvening with you every so often. I have a few people to contact...”</b> his eyes have a faraway look in them as he taps his chin thoughtfully, muttering to himself <b>“Oh no, the SECRET SOCIETY(?) will want to be hearing about this immediately!”</b> He snaps out of his thoughts and smiles widely at you. <b>“I must go now, but please, explore, look for what you must, I’m sure there are many things in this city that will have meaning to you. Oh, this is so exciting! Finally, the prophecy will be fulfilled!”</b></p>
                <p>Without waiting for another second, Ludlow spins and scrambles away, leaving you all alone and baffled in the middle of this bustling city.</p>

            <p>Hello all, and welcome to Trial 3: The Witching Hour!</p>
            <p>This Trial will be run much differently from every Trial in the past, so first and foremost we ask that you bear with us through any hiccups that will inevitably arise! </p>
            <h3>Trial Format</h3> 
            <ul>
              <li>There will be <b>no teams</b> in this Trial!</li>
              <li>This will be set up a bit like the interims where we have a number of location-based roleplay docs rather than separate team docs. Each player will choose where they want to go, with a member number cap on each doc.</li>
              <li>To secure your location, go to the doc you wish to participate in and record your character's name in the "Players" section of the doc header.</li>
              <li>Each location will have a number of <b>hidden quests.</b> To unlock the quests, you must explore or try talking to NPCs.</li>
              <li>Completed quests will give each participant a reward. The rewards will vary anywhere from pieces of information, items, or...something else.</li>
              <li>This trial will consist of alternating rounds of <b>night cycles</b> and <b>day cycles</b>.</li>
              <li>The quests can only be played during the night cycles, which will last approximately seven days--after every night, you will have a chance to gather with the entire group and compare findings, theorize, and rest your characters during the daytime. These day cycles will last <i>two days</i> OOC, where you are allowed to take a break from roleplaying or do free roleplaying as you please.</li>
              <li>At the end of a day cycle, the mods will post a quick summary of anything important that was discovered, and the night cycle will begin again.</li> 
            </ul> 

            <h3>Mod Placement</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>If you aren’t sure where you want your character to go, or you would just rather have us decide for you, leave a comment in the Discord channel #mod-placement.</li>
              <li>A mod will respond with your location placement.</li>
              <li>Your location will not be entirely randomized. We will have a secret method for placements.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Rules</h3> 
            <ul>
              <li>Like every other Trial, to be considered active and save your character from dying at the end, everyone is required to make 5 posts. Please put your post number somewhere on every post, to make it easy for us to keep track.</li>
              <li>You can only roleplay in <b>one location doc</b> at a time.</li>
              <li>For each new night cycle, you will be able once again to choose a new doc to participate in.</li>
              <li>Some quests will be shorter than others. You may be able to join more than one quest per night cycle, but this will be unlikely.</li>
              <li>Once you have joined a quest, do not leave until it’s been finished. If you aren’t sure if you’ve joined a quest or not, ask a mod.</li>
              <li>Checkpoints will be given no less frequently than every other day, but sometimes will come more often than that.</li>
              <li>Try to check your current doc at least once a day if you can to stay updated, but you don’t have to post every time!</li>
              <li>Try your best to communicate with your quest teammates if you are going to be inactive for a long period of time! Alert the mods as well.</li>
              <li>We are trying to keep this trial fairly fast-paced and therefore quests will not wait for players who are inactive. Please be accommodating to a teammate who has missed and needs help catching up if they need it! The mods will do their best as well.</li>

            <p>This part of town, you sense, is not for the faint of heart. These streets and alleyways seem darker and more close, and those hanging around on street corners and under flickering lamps seem to give you suspicious looks. There are vendors buying and selling here as well, but with a sense of discretion that makes you wonder if what they're exchanging is strictly legal.</p>

            <p>It is quieter here and, you sense, more upper class. The buildings seem older, prouder, and more ornate, and there are several open parks for folks to hang out in. It is less festive here as well--you sense that most of the locals bustling around on the street have places to go and things to do.</p>

            <p>A carnival is in town! You see vendors selling wares, locals playing fair games, and performers putting on a show. Down by the water's edge, the festivities continue out onto the piers, where there are also ships docked and waiting to set sail in the morning. Beyond them is a vast expanse of water, and you cannot tell where it ends.</p>
